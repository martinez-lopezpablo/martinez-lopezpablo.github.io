I’m a PhD candidate in Experimental Psychology at the University of Málaga. I study how humans learn habits and the situations that shape when we express them. In my work, I try to combine applied psychometrics with a commitment to transparent, open science. My main interests revolve around associative learning, decision-making, and reinforcement learning.
